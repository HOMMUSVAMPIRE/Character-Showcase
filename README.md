# Character Showcase
This project is intended to showcase my capabilities in the area of creating satisfying character controllers which feel responsive, satisfying, and intuitive. It is also meant to showcase my coding style for possible employers and demonstrate expertise with C# and Unity. Peruse at your own discretion.

This project is still a work in progress. I will be adding to it in my free time as I search for new employment.

Once the project meets my standards for completion, I may release it as a Unity Asset Store package for others to use in their games.
